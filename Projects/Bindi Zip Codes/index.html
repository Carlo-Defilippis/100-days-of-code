        <p class="lead text-center">This is a video showcasing some of the work I did today on a desert companies website called "Bindi" where
            my sister works as a Marketing Manager.  Bindi is an Italian desert company that deals with deliveries in many metropolitan areas.  
            Because of this, they were looking to add a feature on their website that would allow a user to enter the zip code of where they were 
            located and immedietly inform them if they could recieve deliveries.  I added this feature by reading the documentation for the wix/velo 
            code and was able to make a very neat and sleek designed way of achieving this. This involved using functions such as .show(), .onClick(), 
            and some Wix specific functions. </p>
