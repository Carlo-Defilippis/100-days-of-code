# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Roman Numeral Converter.

**Thoughts:** I really had a lot of fun writing the algorithm, I love the feeling of writing code and getting the answer I was looking for, the first time!

### Day 2: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Caesars Cipher encoder.

**Thoughts:** Caesars cipher involved some string manipulation that turned out to be really fun and challenging and I ended up finding out a way to shorten the code significantly!

### Day 3: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a phone number validator that checks if the number is valid, including ('s -'s and digits.

**Thoughts:** Using regex can be very confusing at first but I'm glad I worked on this today and brushed up my skills on it! I was able to shorten the code significantly which makes it less readable but neater.

### Day 4: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a JavaScript version of the classic game of Simon Says.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to make! It works by picking a random number from 1-4 then plays a sound and flashes, this number is then added to an array that the player has to match.

### Day 5: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a JavaScript algorithm that checks if a word or a phrase is a Palindrome. It does this by first removing characters we don't want a whitespace using RegEx or "Regular Expressions" followed by making our string lowercase. I then created a for loop with an index of i and our escape is when i is greater than the length of the string. We check each letter at the beginning and end of the string moving closer to the center in each iteration and if at any point they do not match then we return a false, but if all characters match then we return true.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to figure out! I feel that this algorithm would be useful in many situations and could be modified to work for different problems easily.

### Day 6: February 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm which sorts or bubbles the largest number as last element at the end of each pass.  We compare each element to the one ahead of it, if the element before is smaller, we swap their places.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to figure out! This basic sorting algorithm is somewhat simple but it will help me to understand future sorting algorithms.

### Day 7: February 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Selection Sort is and algorithm that splits the array in two parts: Sorted and Unsorted. The Sorted part is at the beginning of the array and Unsorted part afterwards. Each pass, initially we assume the first element to be the smallest then we loop through the whole array and select the smallest element. At the end of the pass we swap smallest element to the sorted array.

**Thoughts:** This is another somewhat simple sorting algorithm, somewhat similar to the last project, bubble sort.

### Day 8: February 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Quick Sort is and algorithm that is an efficient, recursive divide-and-conquer 
approach to sorting an array. In this method, a pivot value is chosen in the original array. The array is then partitioned into two subarrays of values less than and greater than the pivot value. We then combine the result of recursively calling the quick sort algorithm on both sub-arrays. This continues until the base case of an empty or single-item array is reached, which we return. The unwinding of the recursive calls return us the sorted array.

**Thoughts:** This is another sorting algorithm but this time we impliment recursion. Although recursion can
be somewhat difficult to grasp at times I feel that it is very useful in this sorting algorithm and will be in many other senarios in the future.

### Day 9: February 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my React-Native app for iOS and Android, Cupboard Cleanout is a React-Native app that curates recipes based on the users ingredients, 
allergies, and diet restrictions. Utilizes the Ignite Bowser CLI among many other packages. I adjusted some of the search algorithm and made the dietary list selectable. 

**Thoughts:** This has been a project I have been working on for a few weeks and I have had so much fun learning the ins and outs of React-Native and I'm excited as I'm getting 
more familiar with it as the days and nights pass coding. Another plus is learning TypeScript from starting this project as well! A very error proof language in my opinion!

### Day 10: February 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a video showcasing some of the work I did today on a desert companies website called "Bindi" where
my sister works as a Marketing Manager.  Bindi is an Italian desert company that deals with deliveries in many metropolitan areas.  
Because of this, they were looking to add a feature on their website that would allow a user to enter the zip code of where they were 
located and immedietly inform them if they could recieve deliveries.  I added this feature by reading the documentation for the wix/velo 
code and was able to make a very neat and sleek designed way of achieving this. This involved using functions such as .show(), .onClick(), 
and some Wix specific functions.

**Thoughts:** I had an absolute blast on today's code. It gave me a feel on how its like to work in the coorporate world and I can't wait
to be working in this field!

### Day 11: February 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote a python program using dependancies psaw, datetime, re, requests, numpy, pandas, and yfinance that search the upcoming tob r/wallstreetbets post and
display a list of webpages with their current stock market charts for the past week.

**Thoughts:** This was really fun to figure out mostly because I am new to python but it is a very interesting and versitile language to use. I'm hoping to expand this project to
a user friendly website in the future that can track trending stocks mentioned on wallstreetbets subreddit and maybe maybe more in the future.

### Day 12: March 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote an algorithm that sorts an array using the merge sort method. Like Quick Sort, It works on the principle of Divide and Conquer. Merge sort repeatedly breaks down a list into several sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and merging those sublists in a manner that results into a sorted list.

**Thoughts:** This was a nice finale to my sorting algorithm practices from the past few days. I look forward to moving forward and working with data structures soon in the future.

### Day 13: March 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I am doing a total rework of my online portfolio that features some of my recent work. The base technologies I am using today are React and the gatsby cli. Gatsby is used to build static sites that are Progressive Web Apps, following the latest web standards, and are optimized to be highly performant. It makes use of the latest and popular technologies including ReactJS, Webpack, GraphQL, modern ES6+ JavaScript and CSS.

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to redo my portfolio with performance in mind, also the responsivness and style is exciting to experiment with. As industry standards continue to evolve, I'm ready to learn and become proficient in upcoming technolgies!

### Day 14: March 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More portfolio customization, will upload final product when finished.

### Day 15: March 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: More portfolio customization, will upload final product when finished.

### Day 16: March 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This project draws squares on a grid of 10x10 making 100 boxes.  We then color in the boxes individually by getting the top left point of each box and filling in the rectangle space of 50px by 50px with either green or white.  The animations are visualized smoothly by using async function to pause 70ms between each iteration.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun taking a little time away from my portfolio to do todays project! I have had little experience with canvas in javascript so I am looking forward to learning more in the future.

### Day 17: March 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Investors are driven by two emotions: fear and greed. Too much fear can sink stocks well below where they should be. When 
investors get greedy, they can bid up stock prices way too far. So what emotion is driving the market now? Using the Fear and Greed index provided by a CNN money API we can find out visually along with useing a needle gauge made with the magic of CSS.

**Thoughts:** CSS is one skill I need to brush up on so I enjoyed practicing with this project. Also the use of API's expands the information
that we can show on pages and I love to practice with them also!

### Day 18: March 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I used technolgies such as API's, BootStrap, JQuery and others to make a Free-To-Play game discovery page. This can help people find new free to play games to play. Here is a short description from the main page. "Not sure which game to play next? Don't feel like spending any money to play something new? You've come to the right place! Here you can search for free to play games by Genre, Platform, and a sort order. Go ahead, give it a shot and find your next favorite Free-To-Play game!"

**Thoughts:** Today I worked on a very fun project, I sometimes can't find something to play but also don't want to spend money on a game. So facing this problem I created a free to play game finder
where we can sort by genre, popularity, release date, relevance, alphabetical and platform. It was a lot of fun to fix a real world problem and I cant wait to fix more in the future using javascript
and other languages!

### Day 19: March 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I updated my Free-To-Play game discovery page to be responsive and work great on mobile! I also adjusted the cards to give them a cleaner look, added measures such as "$env.preventdefault()" to fix bugs that happened only on mobile, corrected the order in which cards were displaying, they were previously 
displaying horizontally but I envoked css magic to get them to be responsive and display in the correct order.

**Thoughts:** I am very happy where this project ended up and I hope people get to test it out. Although i spent many many hours on it, I had fun the ENTIRE time, this is how I know this career in web development and coding is what I was ment to do! Any feedback is welcome from my linkedin friends and family.

### Day 20: March 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Using a combination of JavaScript and Python we can detect patterns in the NYSE market. We use modules such as yfinance, flask, bootstrap(for styling), TA-LIB(for analyzing), finviz(for charts visualization). This was made with the help of user hackingfthemarkets' GitHub and much research on pattern recognition tactics. 

**Thoughts:** Today was something new for me, I have never deployed a website with Python so that was challenging yet I learned a lot.  Also as I work more
and more with Python I am learning to love it and JavaScript together! Joining both languages together for this site was fun!

### Day 21/22: March 10/11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: -- React Portfolio - Tooltips and Resume --  Yesterday and today I worked further on my portfolio to make it look better and respond better. A lot of time was spent on design and overall learning how to be more profitiont with ReactJS.  I added a tooltip to certain works on my Resume so employers can get some "fun facts" about me if they hover their mouse over the text.  I also added a background to my resume that simulates real paper and resizes correctly to the page along with the correct text wrap, also working really well on mobile.

**Thoughts:** Phew! I feel like I ran a marathon with my brain for the past 2 days. I absolutely love how ReactJS makes webpages so much faster and how replicating elements is a breeze.  I cannot wait to learn even more about ReactJS in the coming days, and months!

### Day 23: March 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: -- Title Case Algorithm --  Today we work on an algorithm thats refered to as Title Case Converter.  Sometimes we want to manipulate a sentence that a user enters into an input box and this is an example of that. We return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.

**Thoughts:** Decided to get back to basics today and went with an algorithm that formats a users sentence.  I enjoyed figuring out this algorithm and trying to make it as short as possible by using a map function inside of the main funciton followed by a charAt chain of events. Overall I once again had a ton of fun, I am loving this challenge and I'm almost at the 1/4 milestone of 
25 days! Persistance!!

### Day 24/25: March 14/15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: -- Portfolio Contact Form -- Today I added functionality to the contact form.  I used states to track the users inputs and send a call function to a module 
called emailjs, to anyone who hasnt tried it, I highly reccomend! I am in the process of other additions to the portfolio, so expect more to come.

**Thoughts:** After a weekend of not logging my work for my portfolio I decided to give the contact form some function and I could not be any happier!  This portfolio is coming along
great and I cant wait to show it to all prospecting employers and friends.

### Day 26: March 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: -- Game of Life -- Today I had the pleasure of recreating the game of life with ReactJS and JavaScript. The somewhat famous 'Game of Life', also known simply as 'Life', is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine. There are 4 simple rules:
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

**Thoughts:** I've wanted to recreate this ever since seeing this ages ago.  I accomplished this by creating an array of objects with 3 keys, x, y, and true or false(this decides if it is alive and rendered).  
We feed either a random order or a predetermined array with a known pattern into the grid and give each square the rules so it then comes alive and doesnt need any input form us. I learned a lot about ReactJS and 
algorithms in todays project, I love my "job"! :)

### Day 27: March 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: -- Budget tracker -- this records data of money spent and paid, and if the user is offline its saves your user inputs and it then adds the data to the database when it is back online. We accomplish this by using MongoDB to store the information and if the user goes offline it stores the information in the local storage and once it detects the user online again, it sends the updated list to the database. We used technologies such as MongoDB, express, BootStrap, Mongoose.

**Thoughts:** I remember doing a project much like this in bootcamp, this one looks a lot better with a BootStrap touch to it and in the process I learned that AWS is an awesome platform to host on and faster than Heroku so I am looking forward to moving this and other projects in the future to that service!

### Day 28: March 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: -- Password Generator -- This generates a unique password for the user, the user can choose betweem, lower case, upper case letters, special characters, and numbers. I previously did a project somewhat like this in BootCamp but I totally revamped it with JQuery and Bootstrap for a friendly UI.

**Thoughts:** It was fun to go back to my old project and update if with new technologies that I heard learned since graduating. I plan to revamp a bunch of projects that I did in bootcamp, I'm loving it!
