# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Roman Numeral Converter.

**Thoughts:** I really had a lot of fun writing the algorithm, I love the feeling of writing code and getting the answer I was looking for, the first time!

### Day 2: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Caesars Cipher encoder.

**Thoughts:** Caesars cipher involved some string manipulation that turned out to be really fun and challenging and I ended up finding out a way to shorten the code significantly!

### Day 3: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a phone number validator that checks if the number is valid, including ('s -'s and digits.

**Thoughts:** Using regex can be very confusing at first but I'm glad I worked on this today and brushed up my skills on it! I was able to shorten the code significantly which makes it less readable but neater.

### Day 4: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a JavaScript version of the classic game of Simon Says.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to make! It works by picking a random number from 1-4 then plays a sound and flashes, this number is then added to an array that the player has to match.

### Day 5: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a JavaScript algorithm that checks if a word or a phrase is a Palindrome. It does this by first removing characters we don't want a whitespace using RegEx or "Regular Expressions" followed by making our string lowercase. I then created a for loop with an index of i and our escape is when i is greater than the length of the string. We check each letter at the beginning and end of the string moving closer to the center in each iteration and if at any point they do not match then we return a false, but if all characters match then we return true.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to figure out! I feel that this algorithm would be useful in many situations and could be modified to work for different problems easily.

### Day 6: February 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm which sorts or bubbles the largest number as last element at the end of each pass.  We compare each element to the one ahead of it, if the element before is smaller, we swap their places.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to figure out! This basic sorting algorithm is somewhat simple but it will help me to understand future sorting algorithms.

### Day 7: February 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Selection Sort is and algorithm that splits the array in two parts: Sorted and Unsorted. The Sorted part is at the beginning of the array and Unsorted part afterwards. Each pass, initially we assume the first element to be the smallest then we loop through the whole array and select the smallest element. At the end of the pass we swap smallest element to the sorted array.

**Thoughts:** This is another somewhat simple sorting algorithm, somewhat similar to the last project, bubble sort.

### Day 8: February 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Quick Sort is and algorithm that is an efficient, recursive divide-and-conquer 
approach to sorting an array. In this method, a pivot value is chosen in the original array. The array is then partitioned into two subarrays of values less than and greater than the pivot value. We then combine the result of recursively calling the quick sort algorithm on both sub-arrays. This continues until the base case of an empty or single-item array is reached, which we return. The unwinding of the recursive calls return us the sorted array.

**Thoughts:** This is another sorting algorithm but this time we impliment recursion. Although recursion can
be somewhat difficult to grasp at times I feel that it is very useful in this sorting algorithm and will be in many other senarios in the future.

### Day 9: February 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked on my React-Native app for iOS and Android, Cupboard Cleanout is a React-Native app that curates recipes based on the users ingredients, 
allergies, and diet restrictions. Utilizes the Ignite Bowser CLI among many other packages. I adjusted some of the search algorithm and made the dietary list selectable. 

**Thoughts:** This has been a project I have been working on for a few weeks and I have had so much fun learning the ins and outs of React-Native and I'm excited as I'm getting 
more familiar with it as the days and nights pass coding. Another plus is learning TypeScript from starting this project as well! A very error proof language in my opinion!

### Day 10: February 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a video showcasing some of the work I did today on a desert companies website called "Bindi" where
my sister works as a Marketing Manager.  Bindi is an Italian desert company that deals with deliveries in many metropolitan areas.  
Because of this, they were looking to add a feature on their website that would allow a user to enter the zip code of where they were 
located and immedietly inform them if they could recieve deliveries.  I added this feature by reading the documentation for the wix/velo 
code and was able to make a very neat and sleek designed way of achieving this. This involved using functions such as .show(), .onClick(), 
and some Wix specific functions.

**Thoughts:** I had an absolute blast on today's code. It gave me a feel on how its like to work in the coorporate world and I can't wait
to be working in this field!

### Day 11: February 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote a python program using dependancies psaw, datetime, re, requests, numpy, pandas, and yfinance that search the upcoming tob r/wallstreetbets post and
display a list of webpages with their current stock market charts for the past week.

**Thoughts:** This was really fun to figure out mostly because I am new to python but it is a very interesting and versitile language to use. I'm hoping to expand this project to
a user friendly website in the future that can track trending stocks mentioned on wallstreetbets subreddit and maybe maybe more in the future.

100 Days Of Code, Day 11 of 100:

### Day 10: February 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Today I wrote a python program using dependancies psaw, datetime, re, requests, numpy, pandas, and yfinance that search the upcoming top r/wallstreetbets post and
display a list of webpages with their current stock market charts for the past week.  In the future I look forward to adding more parameters and filters to make the results more refined.

**Thoughts:** This was really fun to figure out mostly because I am new to python but it is a very interesting and versitile language to use. I'm hoping to expand this project to
a user friendly website in the future that can track trending stocks mentioned on wallstreetbets subreddit and maybe maybe more in the future.
