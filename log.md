# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Roman Numeral Converter.

**Thoughts:** I really had a lot of fun writing the algorithm, I love the feeling of writing code and getting the answer I was looking for, the first time!

### Day 2: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Caesars Cipher encoder.

**Thoughts:** Caesars cipher involved some string manipulation that turned out to be really fun and challenging and I ended up finding out a way to shorten the code significantly!
