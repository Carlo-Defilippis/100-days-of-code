# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Roman Numeral Converter.

**Thoughts:** I really had a lot of fun writing the algorithm, I love the feeling of writing code and getting the answer I was looking for, the first time!

### Day 2: February 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a Caesars Cipher encoder.

**Thoughts:** Caesars cipher involved some string manipulation that turned out to be really fun and challenging and I ended up finding out a way to shorten the code significantly!

### Day 3: February 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a simple web page with a phone number validator that checks if the number is valid, including ('s -'s and digits.

**Thoughts:** Using regex can be very confusing at first but I'm glad I worked on this today and brushed up my skills on it! I was able to shorten the code significantly which makes it less readable but neater.

### Day 4: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a JavaScript version of the classic game of Simon Says.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to make! It works by picking a random number from 1-4 then plays a sound and flashes, this number is then added to an array that the player has to match.

### Day 5: February 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: This is a JavaScript algorithm that checks if a word or a phrase is a Palindrome. It does this by first removing characters we don't want a whitespace using RegEx or "Regular Expressions" followed by making our string lowercase. I then created a for loop with an index of i and our escape is when i is greater than the length of the string. We check each letter at the beginning and end of the string moving closer to the center in each iteration and if at any point they do not match then we return a false, but if all characters match then we return true.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to figure out! I feel that this algorithm would be useful in many situations and could be modified to work for different problems easily.

### Day 6: February 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Bubble Sort is a sorting algorithm which sorts or bubbles the largest number as last element at the end of each pass.  We compare each element to the one ahead of it, if the element before is smaller, we swap their places.

**Thoughts:** This was a ton of fun to figure out! This basic sorting algorithm is somewhat simple but it will help me to understand future sorting algorithms.
